-- ============================================================================
-- USAGE EXAMPLES
-- ============================================================================

-- To permanently delete a user:
-- SELECT admin_hard_delete_user('user-uuid-here');

-- To list users that can be deleted:
-- SELECT id, name, email, deleted_at 
-- FROM profiles 
-- WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- ============================================================================
-- COMPARISON: Soft Delete vs Hard Delete
-- ============================================================================

-- Soft Delete (current system):
-- UPDATE profiles SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE id = 'user-id';
-- Result: User hidden but data preserved

-- Hard Delete (this function):
-- SELECT admin_hard_delete_user('user-id');
-- Result: User and ALL related data permanently removed

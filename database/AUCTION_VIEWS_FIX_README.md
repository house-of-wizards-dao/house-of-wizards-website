# Auction Views Real-Time Status Fix

## Problem Description

The original `active_auctions` view only filtered by `deleted_at IS NULL`, which meant it showed all non-deleted auctions regardless of their actual time-based status. This caused ended auctions to appear in the "active" category, leading to incorrect auction displays in the UI.

## Solution Overview

This fix implements real-time status calculation in the database views by adding time-based filtering that compares `start_time` and `end_time` with the current timestamp (`NOW()`).

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Views

#### `active_auctions` View
- **Before**: Showed all non-deleted auctions
- **After**: Only shows auctions where `start_time <= NOW()` AND `end_time > NOW()`
- **New fields**: 
  - `real_time_status`: Always 'active'
  - `time_remaining`: Time left until auction ends

#### `auction_details` View  
- **Added**: Real-time status calculation
- **New fields**:
  - `real_time_status`: Calculated based on current time
  - `time_remaining_or_until_start`: Dynamic time calculation
  - `watchers_count`: Number of users watching the auction

#### New Views Created
- **`upcoming_auctions`**: Auctions that haven't started yet (`start_time > NOW()`)
- **`ended_auctions`**: Auctions that have finished (`end_time <= NOW()`)
- **`all_auctions_with_status`**: All auctions with real-time status calculation

### 2. Performance Optimizations

Added new indexes for better query performance:
- `idx_auctions_start_time`: For filtering by start time
- `idx_auctions_time_range`: Composite index on (start_time, end_time)

### 3. Status Logic

The real-time status is calculated as follows:
```sql
CASE 
    WHEN a.status = 'cancelled' THEN 'cancelled'
    WHEN a.end_time <= NOW() THEN 'ended'
    WHEN a.start_time > NOW() THEN 'upcoming'
    WHEN a.start_time <= NOW() AND a.end_time > NOW() THEN 'active'
    ELSE a.status
END
```

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `/database/supabase-schema.sql` - Updated main schema with new views and indexes

### New Files
- `/database/migrations/fix-auction-views-real-time-status.sql` - Migration script to apply changes
- `/database/test-auction-views.sql` - Comprehensive test script to validate changes
- `/database/AUCTION_VIEWS_FIX_README.md` - This documentation file

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: New Database Setup
If setting up a fresh database, use the updated `/database/supabase-schema.sql` file which includes all the fixes.

### Option 2: Existing Database Migration
For existing databases, run the migration script:

1. **Backup your database first!**
2. Run the migration script in your Supabase SQL Editor:
   ```sql
   -- Copy and paste the contents of:
   -- /database/migrations/fix-auction-views-real-time-status.sql
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Application
Run the following SQL commands in order:

```sql
-- 1. Drop existing views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS auction_details;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS active_auctions;

-- 2. Add missing indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_auctions_start_time ON auctions(start_time);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_auctions_time_range ON auctions(start_time, end_time) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- 3. Create new views (see migration file for full SQL)
-- [Insert view creation SQL here]
```

## Testing the Fix

After applying the migration, run the test script to verify everything works correctly:

```sql
-- Copy and paste contents of:
-- /database/test-auction-views.sql
```

The test script will verify:
- ✅ All views exist and are queryable
- ✅ Real-time status calculation is accurate
- ✅ Active auctions are truly active
- ✅ Upcoming auctions are in the future
- ✅ Ended auctions have finished
- ✅ Time calculations are correct
- ✅ Counts are consistent
- ✅ Performance is acceptable

## Breaking Changes

### For Applications Using These Views

1. **New Field**: `real_time_status` field added to all views
2. **Changed Behavior**: `active_auctions` now filters more strictly
3. **New Views**: Applications can now use `upcoming_auctions` and `ended_auctions`

### Recommended Application Updates

```javascript
// Before: Only had active_auctions
const { data: activeAuctions } = await supabase
  .from('active_auctions')
  .select('*');

// After: Can now use specific views for each status
const { data: activeAuctions } = await supabase
  .from('active_auctions')  // Now only truly active
  .select('*');

const { data: upcomingAuctions } = await supabase
  .from('upcoming_auctions')  // New view
  .select('*');

const { data: endedAuctions } = await supabase
  .from('ended_auctions')  // New view  
  .select('*');

// Or use the comprehensive view
const { data: allAuctions } = await supabase
  .from('all_auctions_with_status')
  .select('*');
```

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Accurate Status**: Auction status is now always accurate in real-time
2. **No Polling Needed**: Views automatically reflect current status without background jobs
3. **Better Performance**: Optimized with proper indexes for time-based queries
4. **Cleaner Code**: Applications can now query specific auction states directly
5. **Real-time UI**: UI can show accurate time remaining/until start without additional calculations

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. **Restore the original views**:
```sql
-- Recreate original active_auctions view
CREATE VIEW active_auctions AS
SELECT 
    a.*,
    p.name as creator_name,
    p.avatar_url as creator_avatar,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bids b WHERE b.auction_id = a.id) as total_bids,
    (SELECT b.bidder_id FROM bids b WHERE b.auction_id = a.id AND b.is_winning = TRUE LIMIT 1) as current_winner_id,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auction_watchers aw WHERE aw.auction_id = a.id) as watchers_count
FROM auctions a
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON a.creator_id = p.id
WHERE a.deleted_at IS NULL;
```

2. **Drop new views** if not needed:
```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS upcoming_auctions;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ended_auctions;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS all_auctions_with_status;
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

- The views are now self-maintaining and don't require periodic updates
- Monitor query performance on the auction views after deployment
- The existing `update_auction_statuses()` function can still be used to update the stored status column if needed
- Consider adding alerts for auctions with unreasonable time ranges

## Support

If you encounter any issues with this fix:

1. Run the test script to identify specific problems
2. Check that all indexes are present and being used
3. Verify auction data has reasonable start_time and end_time values
4. Monitor database performance metrics

# House of Wizards DAO Database Schema

Clean, production-ready PostgreSQL schema for Supabase deployment.

## Quick Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Deploy Main Schema
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
# Copy and paste ALL contents of step1-main-schema.sql and run
```

This creates:
- ✅ All tables with relationships and constraints
- ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies 
- ✅ Storage buckets and policies
- ✅ Database functions and triggers
- ✅ Essential indexes (non-concurrent)
- ✅ Initial data (default tags)

### Step 2: Add Performance Indexes
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor:
# Copy and run EACH CREATE INDEX command from step2-performance-indexes.sql ONE BY ONE
# DO NOT run the entire file at once
```

This adds:
- ✅ Optimized concurrent indexes for better performance
- ✅ GIN indexes for JSONB metadata columns
- ✅ Partial indexes for soft-delete patterns
- ✅ Composite indexes for common query patterns

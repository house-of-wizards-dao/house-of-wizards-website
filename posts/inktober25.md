As the first-ever [Wizard Inktober](https://houseofwizards.xyz/inktober) comes to a close, a trace of magic still lingers in the air. For thirty-one days, artists and wizards from across the Runiverse conjured incredible creations from ink and imagination—each one a spark that added to the growing light of the Cult.

We’re deeply grateful to everyone who joined the gathering, bringing their unique vision and creative spirit to every prompt. A special thanks goes to the Cult members whose support and enthusiasm helped shape this event into something truly unforgettable.

Each day, the judges faced an almost impossible challenge—choosing just one piece among so many works of talent and wonder. The winner could claim either a treasure of gold or a warrior of their choosing. To our delight, every winner chose to receive a warrior at least once, meaning the Cult has welcomed several new members into its ranks.

Below you’ll find a glimpse of the artistry that defined this magical month—a selection from each artist who claimed victory at least once during the first Wizard Inktober. May their creations continue to inspire others to summon new worlds from imagination and ink.

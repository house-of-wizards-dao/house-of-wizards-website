The first-ever [Wizard Inktober](https://houseofwizards.xyz/inktober) came to an end. It was amazing to see all the creative submissions throughout the month.

We are extremely grateful for everyone who participated, bringing their unique vision and talent to each prompt. We also want to thank the Cult members who helped make this event possible through their support and engagement.

Each day we had to pick one piece from the submissions, which was often difficult given the quality and creativity on display. The winner could decide to take a cash prize or receive a warrior of their choice. We are happy to say that every winner chose to receive a warrior at least once, so we have a few new cult members!

Here's a submission from each artist who won at least one day.

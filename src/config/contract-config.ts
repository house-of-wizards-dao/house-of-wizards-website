ðŸš€ **Auction Contract Deployment Checklist**

1. **Deploy Contract**
   - Compile the Solidity contract with Hardhat/Foundry
   - Deploy to your chosen network (Sepolia for testing)
   - Note down the contract address and deployment block

2. **Update Configuration**
   - Replace CONTRACT_CONFIGS addresses with your deployed contract
   - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_NETWORK in .env.local
   - Update deployedBlock for efficient event filtering

3. **Environment Variables**
   Add to your .env.local file:
   \`\`\`
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_NETWORK=sepolia
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
   \`\`\`

4. **Test Contract Integration**
   - Connect wallet to same network as contract
   - Test auction creation (owner only)
   - Test bidding functionality
   - Verify events are being emitted

5. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy contract to mainnet
   - Update configuration for mainnet
   - Test with small amounts first
   - Set up monitoring for events and errors

**Smart Contract Functions Available:**
- createNewAuction(name, initialPrice, duration) - Owner only
- sendNewBid(auctionIndex) - Payable, anyone can bid
- getAuctionDetails(id) - View auction state
- closeAuction(id) - Owner only
- withdraw(auctionIndex) - Owner only, withdraw winning bid
- getTotalAuctions() - Get number of auctions
- getBidCount(id) - Get number of bids for auction
